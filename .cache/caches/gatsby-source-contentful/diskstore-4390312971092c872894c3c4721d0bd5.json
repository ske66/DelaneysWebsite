The choice for my colour palette is meant to represent a rainbow of colours in reference to the Wizard of Oz and every character's costume has an element of asymmetry to represent the whimsical world that they live in. Every design has a lot of sequin and beaded embellisment to create a more theatrical, campy look that will make the designs stand out on the stage. I will be making the main character Elphaba as she is seen in Act 2 where her costume references a stereotypical witch appearance but with a more glamourous and sophisticated look.

Taking some of the more featured characters of the ride, I devised an interlinked murder mystery  which created a more condensed storyline than the one featured within the attraction itself. The main idea of the event, is to allow audience members free reign of the mansion to discover the different character plots themselves. Within the event are characters from three succeeding periods from the 1880s through to the 1900s. The costume I am currently making is Constance Hatchaway, a black widow bride who murdered her way up the social ladder. Her costume is an 1890s wedding dress with puffed sleeves, pleated bodice details and a long train stained from the blood of her victims.
